## üíå Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning ‚ù£Ô∏è

This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default based on various fictional and personal attributes.
It includes a two-part exploratory and modeling notebook as well as an user-friendly app for real-time predictions.

|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Loan_Default_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb`     | **Part 1**: Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing       |
| `Loan_Default_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning_Part_2.ipynb` | **Part 2**: Feature selection, model building, and evaluation |
|`loan_prediction_app.py`        | Streamlit-based web application for loan predictions      |
|`loan_approval_model.pkl`                    | Trained model used in the app 
|`loan_predictions.csv`                    | No of predictions made by the app is saved in the format of CSV files

> The project is split across two notebooks for clarity and better observation
> **Part 1** focuses on data cleaning and EDA, while **Part 2** builds and evaluates ML models.

## Objectives üå∏

To assist financial institutions in identifying high-risk loan applicants by:

- Building an accurate classification model using historical loan data
- Creating a web-based app for real-time predictions
 
## Key Features üß£

- Clean, modular analysis across two notebooks
- Future-proof pandas syntax (no chained assignments)
- Interactive prediction interface using Streamlit
- Visual insights from data distribution and correlations
- Multiple machine learning models compared for accuracy

## Limitations Found While Researching about the project!üëá`(*>Ôπè<*)‚Ä≤

While substantial effort has been invested in cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, and deploying this project, analysis reveals that the dataset is biased. Key biases include:

* Gender imbalance (81% Male vs 19% Female)
* Disproportionate credit history availability (84% have credit history)
* Potential model favoring of certain demographics due to skewed training data

As a result, although the model achieves decent accuracy, it may not be fully fair or generalisable to real-world scenarios.

`A bias analysis notebook will be soon added to document and visualise these imbalances, along with suggestions to mitigate them in future iterations.


## Future Enhancements

* Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
* SHAP for model explainability
* Web deployment on Streamlit cloud
* Added input validation and improved UI styling
